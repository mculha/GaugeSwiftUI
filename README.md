# GaugeSwiftUI

Apple introduced a new view which is called Gauge to display progress. 


Apple Official documentation says:
A gauge is a view that shows a current level of a value in relation to a specified finite capacity, very much like a fuel gauge in an automobile. Gauge displays are configurable; they can show any combination of the gaugeâ€™s current value, the range the gauge can display, and a label describing the purpose of the gauge itself.

The video below shows us what we expect when we implement Gauge on our code.
